<p>Take back the web! MomoKO is a simple easy-to-use, easy-to-understand content management system, also known as a CMS. MomoKO is theme-able, customization, and powerful. All of her powerful features happen right on your site, but are only accessible to you. We designed MomoKO from the ground up to be easy to understand and use. If you've ever used a word-processor, you can add, edit, and delete pages from MomoKO with ease. She is also extensible through what we call addins.</p>

<p>To get started with MomoKO you can get the latest stable version above and follow the installation instructions below. Need an example? <a href="http://www.cctmath.org">CCTM</a> runs MomoKO!</p>

<a id="1-acquire-momoko" class="anchor" href="#1-acquire-momoko" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Acquire MomoKO</h3>

<p>Use the links above to download and archive, then extract it, and upload it to your web server using FTP, WebDAV, or whatever protocol is available, or go to github to locate the best URL for you to clone our repository. You may then use git like so <code>git clone https://https://github.com/jjon-saxton/momoko-cms.git</code> to close the repository directly onto your web server.</p>

<h3>
<a id="2-configuring-momoko" class="anchor" href="#2-configuring-momoko" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Configuring MomoKO</h3>

<p>Once you have MomoKO on your server and accessable to the world, you will have to configure her. These instructions assume your acquired the latest stable version. If you did not, please see the <code>README.md</code> included the repo you downloaded or cloned. In the folder you place MomoKO in on your server there is a sub-folder called <code>assets</code> in there is a sub-folder called <code>etc</code>. <code>etc</code> is where the configuration files are kept. Currently only one file, <code>version.nfo.txt</code> exists. This file simply holds the current version number. To configure MomoKO copy the contents of the sub-folder <code>examples</code> into the folder <code>etc</code>. Over SSH the following command should work: <code>cp -r ./examples/* ./</code></p>

<p>You should get to files, <code>dal.conf.txt</code> and <code>main.conf.txt</code>. First open <code>main.conf.txt</code>, this is used to set up MomoKO's environment variables so she knows where things are and what things are called. We will define the settings below.</p>

<h4>
<a id="21-mainconftxt-settings" class="anchor" href="#21-mainconftxt-settings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1 main.conf.txt Settings</h4>

<p>basedir
:   This sets the location of your MomoKO's scripts. This should be set to the <em>absolute</em> path to the folder MomoKO was put in when you acquired her.</p>

<p>pagedir
:   This sets the location where MomoKO's pages will be stored. In the example, we show the absolute path to assets/pages, but this can be <em>any</em> folder on your file system that your web server software can read and write to.</p>

<p>filedir
:   Like the above, but sets were MomoKO will look for photos, videos, and other types of files other than pages.</p>

<p>tempdir
:   Like the above, but sets where MomoKO will store temporary files</p>

<p>domain
:   Not set in the example, this is where you can store the fully qualified domain name of your site. If you leave this blank MomoKO will try to use global environment variables to guess your domain.</p>

<p>location
:   The location of you site according to your web server software. This is often just the folder underneath you web document folder where you put MomoKO, but this can be different if your server uses userdirs. Please consult your server documentation if this is the case. If in doubt, leave blank and see if there are errors.</p>

<p>session
:   Gives the MomoKO session a name, by default this is 'mk', there should be no need to change it unless you have multiple MomoKO instances on your server or something else that sets a cookie with that name.</p>

<p>salt
:   Used to encrypt passwords, the salt characters are prepended to the password and alters the output. The example sets this to 'mk', there should be no need to change this unless you simply want more security by being more unique.</p>

<p>rewrite
:   If your server supports mod_rewrite you can use included rewrite rules. Move the <code>.htaccess</code> file to your MomoKO's basedir and set this to true. This will generate more search-engine and human friendly URLS</p>

<a id="22-dalconftxt-settings" class="anchor" href="#22-dalconftxt-settings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.2 dal.conf.txt Settings</h4>

<p>type
:   This is the type of database server you have. This instructs the Database Abstraction Layer on what driver to load. Please ensure a driver exists and/or as been installed for your server type. Also uses all lower-case for this value. If you use a MySQL server, type mysql here; for SQLite2 type sqlite, for SQLite3 use sqlite3.</p>

<p>table_pre
:   A prefix to prepend to table names. This can be anything you chose, but we advise you to have an underscore '_' character at the end. Leaving this blank will generate simple names with no prefix. You might do this for a dedicated database.
file
:   For SQLite2 and SQLite3, specify the <em>absolute</em> path to the database file.</p>

<p>host
:   For MySQL and others, specify the fully qualified domain name for your database server.</p>

<p>user
:   The user name of MomoKO's database user. This user must have full read write rights to the database listed below. The easiest method is to create this user and than chose to create a database with their name and grant them all privledges.</p>

<p>password
:   The password of the user above. Do <strong>NOT</strong> leave this blank. For security this user <strong>needs</strong> a password! The only exception would be an SQLite2 or SQLite3 database where no user is used.</p>

<p>default
:   The name of the default database. The user specified above needs full privledges for this database!</p>

<a id="3-prepare-your-database" class="anchor" href="#3-prepare-your-database" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Prepare your database</h3>

<p>Once configured you need to set up required tables on your database and create an administrator for your site. Once this is done, you will be able to login, create pages, and additional users. Fortunately this task is made simple by the inclusion of a finalization script. This procedure can only be completed via SSH at this time. A web front-end will be created shortly, which will allow you to complete this procedure in your web browser.</p>

<p>To use this method you will need SSH access to your server!</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to you server via SSH</li>
<li>Navigate to your MomoKO installation and change to <code>assets/php/cli</code>
</li>
<li>Run <code>install.php</code>

<ol>
<li>Ensure <code>install.php</code> is executable and type: <code>./install.php</code>
</li>
<li>If this files try: <code>php ./install.php</code>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li>
</ol>
