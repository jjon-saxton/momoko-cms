MomoKO Content Managment System - The web is *yours* again!

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

### 1. Acquire MomoKO

There are two quick and easy methods for getting your hands on MomoKO's code. Both methods make use of her git repo. The first and best method is using git on your server, but this requires SSH access. If you don't have SSH access, or don't know what SSH is you can download a ZIP file from our repo. I will describe both methods below.

#### 1.1 Using git

The steps outlined here will help you set up a folder on your server as a local git repository. You will than be able to set our repo up as a remote origin and pull in MomoKO. This method is the quickest and allows you to easily upgrade when new updates are made available. SSH access to your web host is **required**!

1. Log in to your server via SSH, instructions on this procedure vary depending on your SSH client. Consult your client's instruction manual for details.
2. Once you have an shell prompt create a folder for MomoKO or change to your web folder either `mkdir momoko && cd momoko` or `cd public_html` replace momoko or public_html with the correct folder name.
3. Set-up git in the folder you switched to; `git init`
4. Set our repo as this folder's remote origin: `git remote add origin https://github.com/jjon-saxton/momoko-cms.git`
5. Download from git: `git pull origin latest_stable`
6. Proceed to 'Configuring MomoKO'

#### 1.2 Using FTP

If you have SSH access and prefer not to set up or install git, or you want to upload from your local machine you may use wget or another FTP client to acquire MomoKO's source code in a zip archive. Please note: though this is written specifically for wget on Linux, or FireFTP you may use wget on any supported operating system, or any FTP client you choose. The important thing to note here is that you will be logging into the FTP server anonymously!

##### 1.2.1 Text-based: wget

1. Open a terminal and/or log in. If you wish to download and extract directly from you server login to it via SSH.
2. To download the latest stable version of MomoKO you need only type `wget ftp://saxton-solutions/pub/momoko/core/latest_stable/*.zip`. The '*' is a wildcard which will make wget grab all zip files in the directory 'pub/momoko/core/latest_stable' There is only one archive in this folder at all times and it is the latest stable version of MomoKO so this will only grab the files you need. if you want a different version type `wget ftp://saxton-solutions.com/pub/momoko/core/momoko-cms-myversion.zip` replacing 'myversion' with the version you want. Keep in mind we use an x.x.xa version system. If you don't know what versions are available it's best to get a listing of the 'pub/momoko/core/' directory using Linux's built in FTP client or a graphical one.
3. Extract the zip archive. This is a zip file so unzip will be needed to extract it. Type `unzip momoko-cms-1.1.2.zip` or the file name you acquired from wget, you can also use `unzip momoko-cms*.zip` if you aren't sure. This will create a folder like 'momoko-cms-latest_stable' or 'momoko-cms-1.1-STABLE'. You may wish to simply rename this to 'momoko' or something similar.
4. If you ran all of these under an SSH login to your remote server than you are done and may proceed to 'Configure MomoKO'. If you did this locally you may wish to still proceed to 'Configure MomoKO' if you do not have SSH access, just don't forget to upload the **entire** folder to your server via FTP, FTPS, or whatever files upload method is available *before* proceeding to 'Preparing your database'. Make sure the file upload method can support folder uploads.

##### 1.2.2 Graphically: FireFTP

1. Open your favorite FTP client, for this example we'll be using FireFTP, so we will be opening Firefox then clicking FireFTP in te toolbar or developer menu, but you may open just about any client.
2. Click the drop down and select 'create an account' to open the account manager. In some clients you need simply choose 'connect'.
3. Find the 'host' field and type 'saxton-solutions.com'.
4. Leave any 'login' and 'password' fields blank and find the checkbox labeled 'Anonymous' or something similar and make sure it is checked. Click 'Ok' then click 'connect'.
5. Weclome to SaxtonSolutions! On the right pane (or remote pane) you will see a list of directories, expand them like so pub->momoko and click 'core' to open it. Select the zip of the version you want. Note: if you just want the latest stable version enter the 'latest-stable' directory, this houses only one archive, so just select that one.
6. Double click the archive you selected, or right click and click download. You may also drag and drop it anyone in the left (local) pane.
7. After the file has downloaded right click it and select open to open it in your computer's default archive manager.
8. We won't go into details here as archive managers vary widely, but you need to extract all of the files into a folder, while keeping the directory structure in the archive.
9. Proceed to 'Configure MomoKO', but upload the **entire** folder to your server *before* moving on to 'Preparing your database'

### 2. Configuring MomoKO

Once you have MomoKO it is time to configure her. As of version 1.6 you will only need to configure MomoKO to connect to a database server. All other settings will be handled in the next step 'Prepare your database'. Database configuration is stored in `database.ini` now in the directory you store MomoKO in.

1. Open database.ex.ini
2. Under the `[database]` section set the driver, host, and port. Driver is the PDO driver you wish to use. This should match the type of database you are trying to connect to i.e. for a MySQL database this would be `driver=mysql` for and SQLLite database it might be `driver=sqllite`. Host would the file or resource you would access, for MySQL this is often `host=localhost`. By default the 'port' option is commented out, but you my use it to set a different port.
3. Under the `[schema]` section set the name, user, password, and tableprefix. Name is the name of the database schema you wish to store MomoKO's data in. User, if applicable, is the user name you will use to connect to the schema, and password is their password. The tableprefix option is used to set a special prefix for this MomoKO installation's tables. This can be used to seperate this installation from others in the same schema, or to seperate MomoKO's table from others.
4. Please place a semicolan ';' in front of any setting you do not use to comment it out. You **do not** need to empty their settings, but you may wish to keep them in case you change something later.

### 3. Prepare your database

Once configured you need to set up required tables on your database and create an administrator for your site. Once this is done, you will be able to login, create pages, and additional users. Fortunately this task is made simple by the inclusion of a finalization script. This procedure can only be completed via SSH at this time. A web front-end will be created shortly, which will allow you to complete this procedure in your web browser.

#### 3.1 Run install.php CLI over SSH

To use this method you will need SSH access to your server!

1. Login to you server via SSH
2. Navigate to your MomoKO installation and change to `assets/php/cli`
3. Run `install.php`
    1. Ensure `install.php` is executable and type: `./install.php`
    2. If this files try: `php ./install.php`
4. Follow the onscreen instructions.

### Congratulations!

Your site is now configured and ready. Login as the administrator you created above and begin adding content!

Upgrading MomoKO
----------------

Upgrading MomoKO can be simple if you used git to acquire her. Otherwise the procedure is a bit more difficult.
