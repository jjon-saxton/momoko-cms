This folder is the default location for temporary files. MomoKO uses temporary files to provide session-by-session information and examine files before they are accepted.

Also archives may be temporarily stored here both in file form and extracted before they are moved to a perminent home. This is done often to ensure the archive is of an expected nature or to maniupulate some content before moving it to a better place.

You can configure a different location within you MomoKO installation to serve as temporary storage, but this version does not support other folders.

You may remove this INFO file at any time and it may be a good idea to check this location every now-and-then to ensure it is clean. When MomoKO no longer needs information stored here, she should remove it, but processes could be interrupted and MomoKO may leave small traces behind.
